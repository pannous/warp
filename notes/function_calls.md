# Function calls (functions worker, 2026-10-06)

Ported call forms from Python, Kotlin, Swift, C#, JS/TS, Ruby and Julia; tests in tests/functions/, the quick case
list in probes/function_calls.md (run probes/function_calls.sh after scripts/own-warp.sh).

## Decided forms (defaults taken, Interviewer asked where marked)
- Defaults: `f(a, b=2)`, typed `f(a, b:int=2)`, a default may read earlier parameters `f(a, b=a*2)`. Named
  arguments `f(b=1)` / `f(b:1)` skip defaults and mix with positional ones (P37).
- Overloading by arity: `def f(a)` + `def f(a,b)` become `f·1`, `f·2` (src/lowering/overloads.rs
  `lower_arity_overloads`, a MEANING pass before broadcasting reads arities). A call names the variant its argument
  count fits; none or two fitting (`f(a)` + `f(a, b=2)` called `f(5)`) is an error. Methods: class_methods prepends
  `self`, so a method's variant number is one more than written.
- Rest parameters: `xs...` (Julia/Swift), `...xs` (JS), `*xs` (Python) all mean the same (the parser turns `...xs`
  into the starred `*xs` of tuples.rs). Only the last parameter. `total(1,2,3)` → `total([1 2 3])`.
- Spreading: `f(...xs)`, `f(xs...)`, `f(*xs)`: into a rest parameter the list is passed as is (`[2] + xs` after other
  leftovers), into fixed parameters as `xs#1, xs#2, …`. Static: no run-time arity check, a plain call
  (src/lowering/variadic.rs, a SOURCE pass before named_arguments).
- Partial application stays `add(1, _)`; `add(1)` is a missing-argument error.

## Open
- P124 (Interviewer): a closure assigning a captured variable (`()=>{ n+=1; n }`) silently restarts from the
  captured value; `nonlocal n` inside a lambda fails.
